# pip-inside

I use `pip`, so I have `requirements.txt`, and might `requirements-dev.txt` as well.

Later when I started to configure my `black`, `isort`, `pypy`..., I have `pyproject.toml`.

Then I  wanted to move `requrements.txt` into `pyproject.toml`, as it's feature-rich, then I saw [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

After used poetry for months, I started to missing `pip`, as `poetry`:
 - sometimes slow, and sometimes quite slow
 - hash mismatch, then I have to delete my entire cache, and download everything again
 - when you have huge dependencies like `torch` (~2 GB), too bad to install a general version, then a working version later in `toe` plugin

So this `pip-inside` comes out. It's just `flit-core` with `pip` as the dependency installer.

It does NOT have following features (might add some of them later):
 - hash checking
 - version freezing
 - dependency tree
